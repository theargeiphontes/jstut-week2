# Javascript Tutorial Week 2

Done:

- Added a REST endpoint that retrieves our notes
- Added an AJAX call to retreive our notes from the REST endpoint
- Write our notes into the DOM

Todo:

- Wire up the form handler to:
    - onClick process form
    - Get form data
    - Send to server
- Add the POST handler to the REST API
- Write the new notes file to the filesystem
- Refactor: move the AJAX call that loads notes into a function so we can call it when the POST is successful
